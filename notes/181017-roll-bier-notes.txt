Michael:
  6LowPan also needs to be supported today in transit routers to
  be able to forward packets
  Q: will this be true for BIER forwarding of packets ?
     If yes, then BIER would be part of 6LowPan.
     If no, its a layer below it.

  6LowPan is somewhat of an L2.5, hop-by-hop, aka: answer would be that
  6LowPan would need to be expanded to know about BIER bitstring hop-by-hop

Toerless Q:
  Any value in considering to carry non-IPv6 (unicast/multicast) packets ?
  Maybe not relevant given how 6LowPan compresses the IPv6 header down to "irrelevant" overhead.
  -> will put non-IP app packets below the line.

Mcr: Storing/Non-Storing mode impact on forwarding:
  In storing mode, packet goes from uptree to downtree in common parent.
  In non-storing mode, packets always go through root node.
  .. would work the same with BIER, just need to write it down.

Mcr:  RPL does not support multicast. Need to run 'NPL' ? need to run specific mode... ?
Toerless:
  - Aka: extension to send multicast 6LR to 6LR.

Offline: 6tisch relationship: More an L2 with BW reservation layer, also relies on 6LowPan on top.
